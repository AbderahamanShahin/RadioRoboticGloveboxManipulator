## Description

The Radio Robotic Glovebox Manipulator is a robotic system designed to enhance safety, precision, and automation inside nuclear gloveboxes used by operators to handle radioactive materials. While gloveboxes offer protection, operators are still exposed to low levels of radiation and face challenges related to visibility, mobility, and task repetitiveness due to the bulky gloves.

Our solution uses two wearable smart gloves, each equipped with sensors and microcontrollers, to capture the operator's arm and hand movements. These movements are transmitted wirelessly to a pair of 6-DOF robotic arms mounted inside the glovebox, replicating the operator's actions in real time.

In addition to manual control, the system includes an automation framework that allows operators to record sequences of movements and replay them as needed, reducing fatigue and increasing operational efficiency. The system also features a mobile application for control and task management, and a custom-designed PCB for compact and accurate sensor integration.

This project merges software, electronics, and mechanical design to provide a safer and smarter alternative for handling hazardous materials in controlled environments.
